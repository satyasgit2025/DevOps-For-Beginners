The application development team has shared that they are planning to deploy one newly developed application on infra in DC.
The application uses PostgreSQL database, so as a pre-requisite we need to set up PostgreSQL database server as per requirements shared below.
PostgreSQL database server is already installed on the database server. 
a. Create a database user kloud_joy and set its password to YchZHRcLkL.
b. Create a database kloud_db6 and grant full permissions to user kloud_joy on this database. 
Note: Please do not try to restart PostgreSQL server service.
